# chess-engine

In this project, I build my own chess-engine written in Python.
Chess is one of my biggest passions along with programming, therefore I decided to combine both of them to build a scalable chess-engine from scratch using Python with Flask. The project includes all fundementals of chess in a web application.

## Usage guide

### _How to play?_

By default there will be a session to keep track of the current game state, player turns as well as the captured pieces by both sides.
Following the rules of chess, you can learn more about it [`here`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess).

To make a move, you have to select the piece you want to move and then follow it up with a designated square to move to. The game will automatically update the board accordingly.
